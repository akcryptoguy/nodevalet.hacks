Your warranty is void if you use anything in this repository.

I have created this repository to store scriptlets and features which we decided not to include in the main Node Valet repository since their functionality has not been thoroughly tested and/or may cause instability or undesirable effects on your VPS.  Please understand this and use them at your own risk.  Do not count on Node Valet support to help you at all if you use anything contained in this repo.
